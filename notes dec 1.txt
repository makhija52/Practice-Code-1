object oriented programing is a way of giving entities to objects

class-complex data type which contains multiple values and methods(functions that are part of a class)

object-particular instance of a class

property-varaible contained by a class

method-function of a class

constructor-initialize an individual object of a class

//first define class,

class GravityBall{
//list info we need to track each GravityBall
//location
//velocity
//acceleration
//size

//declare our variables
PVector loc,vel,acc;
float sz;

//create the constructor which lets us initialize variables

GravityBall(){

sz=50
loc=newPvector(width/2,100);
vel=newPVector(0,0);
acc=new PVector(0,0.1);

	}


//////////below we will be defining methods, which are things GravityBall will be able to do/////////
