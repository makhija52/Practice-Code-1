object oriented programing is a way of giving entities to objects

class-complex data type which contains multiple values and methods(functions that are part of a class)

object-particular instance of a class

property-varaible contained by a class

method-function of a class

constructor-initialize an individual object of a class

//first define class,

class GravityBall{
//list info we need to track each GravityBall
//location
//velocity
//acceleration
//size

//declare our variables
PVector loc,vel,acc;
float sz;

//create the constructor which lets us initialize variables

GravityBall(){

sz=50
loc=newPvector(width/2,100);
vel=newPVector(0,0);
acc=new PVector(0,0.1);

	}


//////////below we will be defining methods, which are things GravityBall will be able to do/////////










////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Array has a fixed length
ArrayList size is determined by how many items in the list
add to the ArrayList using the .add() method
Array lets us work directly with the contents, but an ArrayList doesnt
bouncyBall b =balls.get(0); //created a placeholder called b to store the item you want to work with


ArrayList <BouncyBall> = new ArrayList<BouncyBall>();
